# Chrome-Dino-Arduboy-2

Chrome Dino, you all know him, you love him, the little guy that appears when your wifi is pooped on Chrome. An enjoyable experience while you wait, or if you just enjoy some games.

This is a redo of chrome dino for the Arduboy (original: https://github.com/flaki/arduboy-rund-ino). I did a little bit of recoding for it to fix and improve some issues, I based the code from the halloween edition and imported the regular sprites.

v0.1.0 - The new v0.1.0 version now supports Arduboy 2 (and homemade), after 3 hours of tweaking on a school night he is ready to entertain you (Images of the game coming soon)
